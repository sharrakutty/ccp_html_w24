            <p>Monteverde, Costa Rica is situated 4,662 feet above sea level. Monteverde’s famed cloud forests are the byproduct of fog (a thick, low-hanging cloud) tangling amongst the leaves and branches of the forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the diverse variety of animals and plants living in the forest.</p> 
            <p>One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa Elena, which is not only home to a variety of restaurants with delicious food, but a serpentarium as well. You can enjoy hiking, ziplining, and observing the native wildlife while staying in Monteverde. It’s a truly beautiful place. </p>
